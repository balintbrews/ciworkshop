Setup our sample Drupal project in your local machine. Fork the following repositories on GitHub:

  * [https://github.com/balintk/cidrupal-platform](https://github.com/balintk/cidrupal-platform)
  * [https://github.com/balintk/cidrupal-profile](https://github.com/balintk/cidrupal-profile)

You need to modify *platform.make* (which you find in the platform repository), and point to your forked profile's repository.
